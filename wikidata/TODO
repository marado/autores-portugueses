There is the sort of info we seek with this set of scripts on wikidata. Moreover, it is easilly queryable, and visualizable.

Our actions regarding that should be two-fold:
1) use wikidata as a source (and, eventually, the main - or even only - source);
2) (later) use the other data sources in order to generate what is needed to actually feed info into wikidata.

More info on how to actually see that info on wikidata can be seen on the `query` file.
